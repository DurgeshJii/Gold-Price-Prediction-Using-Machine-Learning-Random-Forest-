# Gold-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Random-Forest-
This project focuses on predicting gold prices (GLD) using historical financial and economic indicators with the help of machine learning. A Random Forest Regressor model is trained on real-world data to capture complex, non-linear relationships between gold prices and correlated market variables.
